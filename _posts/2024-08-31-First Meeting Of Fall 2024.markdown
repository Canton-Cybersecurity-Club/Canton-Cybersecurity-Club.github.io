## First Club Meeting, Fall Semester 2024
Hello colleagues!

Welcome back to school; I hope your first few weeks of classes have been going well. 

I am scheduling our first meetup for Tuesday, Sep 3rd, at 6:00 PM EST 

The goal of the meeting is to introduce everyone to each other, talk about what this club is all about, and think about coming up with some goals for this semester.

I hope to see everyone soon, so don't be shy!
