## JOIN US!!!
We are actively seeking new people who are interested in participating in [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) events. If you would like to join us and learn with us along the way, consider joining [Discord](https://discord.gg/uu6tw8AgQT). 

Currently our club has remote meetings on discord because of the large ammount of remote students. 

Don't worry if you feel like an imposter! The whole point of CTF's are to learn cybersecurity knowlege and skills with gamification!
