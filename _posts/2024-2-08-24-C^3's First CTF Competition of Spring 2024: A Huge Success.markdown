## C^3's First CTF Competition of Spring 2024: A Huge Success
Hey Roos,

Your Canton Cybersecurity Club participated in the Bearcat CTF hosted by the University of Cincinatti last weekend. Out of 185 teams we placed 25th. What an amazing performance for our first major competition with a full roster.

### C^3's CTF Roster

| Member | Points |
| --------- | --------- |
| _ep | 2400 |
| roophil | 1700 |
| Tennessee | 700 |
| Kolbe | 500 |

Big ups to _ep for his outstanding performance and for securing tons of points (pun intended). Shout out to Tennessee for bringing us together to bond, learn, and have fun. Go Kolbe; while everyone else was resting, he figured out an elusive problem that had everyone stumped. And special mention to LordToph for hopping in the Discord and hanging out with us.

### Lessons Learned
CTF experiences like this are invaluable. Being able to apply the concepts learned in class in a gamified way helps us reinforce our knowledge, develop our skill sets, and have a blast doing so. Most importantly, we are able to bond as a unit of cybersecurity nerds. 

It's not easy to sacrifice time away from family and friends, sleep, our gaming consoles, coursework, and everything else we could be doing. But we did it, and we choose to continue doing it, in an effort to grow as cybersecurity students and practitioners.

### Concepts Explored

| Challange | Concept | Method |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| No Humans | robots.txt & user agents | Parse hundreds of lines in the robots.txt file to find a working path. |
| Proclicker V2 | cookies & source code | Manipulate client-side cookies after analyzing weaknesses in source code. |
| Password Buffer | buffer overflow | specially crafted user input was used to force a password we controlled. |
| Parisian Adventure | Google Maps Plus Codes | Finding the location of an image using google maps and plus codes. |
